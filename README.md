Pong.java creates an interactive pong game which someone can play versus the computer. You can also play person v person or computer v computer if you so desire. However, the computer always wins, as its paddle is set to always perfectly follow the y coordinate of the ball, so this game of pong is not particularly fair. The left paddle is controlled with the s and w keys, while the right is controlled by the up and down arrow keys.
